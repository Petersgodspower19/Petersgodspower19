# Hi, I'm Peters Godspower!

I'm a passionate full-stack developer who enjoys building creative, meaningful web experiences. My work spans across frontend and backend development â€” from crafting sleek UIs in React to building robust APIs with Node.js and Express, and working with databases like MySQL and MongoDB.

I enjoy learning new technologies, working on real-world apps, and bringing ideas to life through code. Whether it's a blog platform, a personal assistant site, or a real-time polling app, I'm always eager to create solutions that are both functional and visually engaging.
